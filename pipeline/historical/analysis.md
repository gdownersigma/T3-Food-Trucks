# T3 Food Truck Fleet - Data Analysis Recommendations

## Executive Summary

Based on the analysis of transaction data from the T3 food truck fleet, we have identified several key insights and recommendations to improve business performance.

## Key Findings

### Payment Methods

- **Super Smoothie lacks card payment capability.** This truck is currently cash-only, which likely results in lost sales as customers increasingly prefer card payments.
- Overall, card payments slightly outnumber cash transactions across the fleet, confirming the importance of card reader availability.

### Truck Performance

- **Burrito Madness is the top performer.** This truck generates significantly higher revenue than others and should be considered a model for success.
- **Hartmann's Jellied Eels has notably reduced revenue.** This truck is underperforming compared to the rest of the fleet and requires attention.

### Peak Trading Times

- **Busiest hours are between 11:00 and 17:00**, with a significant peak at 14:00 (2pm).
- Trucks should ensure full staffing and stock availability during these hours to maximise sales.

### Busiest Days

- **Sunday, Monday, and Thursday** showed the highest transaction volumes in this sample.
- However, more data is needed to confirm weekly patterns and plan staffing accordingly.

## Recommendations

1. **Install a card reader at Super Smoothie immediately.** The lack of card payment option is likely turning away customers and reducing potential revenue.

2. **Investigate Jellied Eels' underperformance.** Consider factors such as location, menu appeal, pricing, or customer service that may be contributing to lower sales.

3. **Learn from Burrito Madness.** Analyse what makes this truck successful (menu, location, service speed) and apply these learnings to other trucks.

4. **Optimise staffing for peak hours.** Ensure all trucks are fully staffed between 11:00-17:00, particularly around 14:00.

5. **Collect more data.** The current sample size limits our ability to draw firm conclusions about weekly patterns. Continued data collection will enable more robust analysis.

## Next Steps

- Implement card payments at Super Smoothie
- Conduct a review of Jellied Eels operations
- Schedule a follow-up analysis once more data is available
